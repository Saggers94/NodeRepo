--> Node js has event loop which is an infinite loop that will run and  listen
to the requests and only if you unregister it with "process.exit()", only than
this event loop would break and stop running.
--> Node js uses single thread of the OS and its very fast, however on deeper side if the single thread
is overloaded than it would take multi thread approach by leveraging the OS
--> Node passes the data of the form in the form of streams which we can get access to through buffers, and we 
do it by registering an event that listens to 'data', and we can achieve that through "req.on(data)" 

----NodeJS working with Registry----
--> When we register an event with its listener function, NodeJs would register that event in its internal registery 
and won't execute it right away, it will wait until the event is triggered only than it will look back through the 
registry and check if the event matches and than will execute the listener function.

--> NodeJs has events and all of the events executes its listeners when we trigger it through some code and that's 
why NodeJs is Asynchronous and it does never get blocked in one operation which makes execution faster and better.

 WE can write scripts in the scripts section in below. In this scripts, With Some reserved keywords like "start", you 
 can run it with "npm start" while the scripts that are manual, for example, in the below case we have "start-server",
 in that case we would need to use "npm run start-server" to run the script.

--> NodeMon package from the npm cloud package storage is responsible to make development easier. For example,
if we add a new code in the app.js file than we wouldn't have to go to the terminal and write "npm start" again, Nodemon
would refresh the server with the new code automatically.

we can install Nodemon through "npm install nodemon --save-dev", where "--save-dev" is to let us know that this is 
for only development purposes.


---EXPRESS JS----

--> We add express Js as it will provide us tools and functions through which we will have 
a huge redunduncy in the vanilla Nodejs Code. For example, Routing, Extracting 

--> Express Js is a framework for nodejs. It will provides tools and functions that will be helpful in writing 
nodejs code and we won't have to write the detailed Vanilla NodeJS code

--> Express JS is all about MiddleWare

--> Template engine are not part of the server side code, so even though you change them, it won't trigger nodemon to refresh the server,
and whatever values you will passed to the template will reflect without causing refresh in node server
